## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of form validation, controlled inputs in React, and conditional rendering.

I learned how to:

- Manage form state using `useState`
- Validate inputs and highlight only the fields with errors
- Create custom styled radio buttons while keeping them accessible via keyboard
- Handle form submission logic and calculations in React
- Conditionally render results and empty states
- Improve accessibility by supporting keyboard navigation (Tab, focus states)

This project also helped me better structure components and write cleaner, more readable JSX.
